#+TITLE: Intelligent Crossing Roads

* System

#+CAPTION: A crossing road control (CRC) can implement two policies: straight-right crossing (SRC) or straight-right-left crossing (SRC).
#+NAME:   fig:01

The two policies implement the following permission to cross rules
- SRLC :: FIFO
- SRC :: On rotation, permission goes either to cars from N&S or from E&W
  - If it is the N&S turn, ~n~ cars from N and ~n~ cars from S receive the permission to go
  - If there are ~m<n~ cars waiting from one direction, only ~m~ orders are sent
  - If zero cars are waiting to cross, the turn goes to E&W (and vice versa)
  - If a car crosses, it notifies the crossing to the system

* Exercises

** Implement a set of rules of in CLIPS for SRLC
** Implement a set of rules of in CLIPS for SRC
** Implement the random arrival of cars from any direction to check the correct behaviour in SRLC and SRC
